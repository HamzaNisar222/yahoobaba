FOR CREATING TABLES WE USE MIGRATION FILES IN MIGRATION FOLDER
for creating tables in core php we write raw queries to create table butt in laravel
we use migration files to create tables
COMMANDS
php artisan make:migration filname

everything is done by running the command
return new class etends MIgration{
    public function up():void{
         Schema(CLASS)::create{METHOD}('students',function(Blueprint{CLASS for datatypes} $table){
             //then we work in this function 
             $table->id(){This is a method whoch makes id a primary key};
             $table->string('name',30){string is also a method which is defined in Blueprint class to give datatype VARCHAR};
         })
    }  
}
after definign the table in the above function we run a command 

php artisan migrate //This creates the table in the database
